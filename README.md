This is another version of LibMiriSDR-4 but corrected for Windows and more stable.  The great honor for the hard work should be given to Miroslav Slugen and additions of Leif Asbrink SM5BSZ. Please, if you using the code to citate these two authors. They spend many hours to break the meaning of registers in the not documented chip.

*support for Windows 10/11 through WinUSB (the newest version)
*The bulk  synchronous transfer is improved
*The asynchronous transfer is not yet tested.
* the code is as simple as possible with all the original coments
* *there is a small problem with transfer stability during change of rate (almost fixed)
